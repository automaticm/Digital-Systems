#### Repository for completed projects for my Digital Systems class.

#### Each one of these labs uses the STM32F4DISCOVERY development board; which contains the STM32F4 microcontroller and is based on the ARM Cortex M4 chip. You can look at the F4 manual in the root of this repository.

#### Compile and run using STM32CubeIDE (or if you prefer, a different IDE).
